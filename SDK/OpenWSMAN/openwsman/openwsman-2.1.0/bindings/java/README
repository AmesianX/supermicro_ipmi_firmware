Java Bindings 
================


Running test program
---------------------

You have to run configure with the --enable-java option. This will generate the java
files for the openwsman client. After installation with 'make install' compile the java
files with a java compiler, for example:

# javac *.java

This will generate the class files. To run the sample program, run

# java test_identify

Make sure to modify the code to reflect your wsman service settings and authentication data.
