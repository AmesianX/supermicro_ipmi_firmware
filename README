This is the source code to the SuperMicro IPMI Firmware.  Apparently, not all of this is open source, so some of the files are provided as binaries.

This was originally extracted from ftp://ftp.supermicro.com/GPL/SMT/SDK_SMT_X9_317.tar.gz

I removed the SDK/ToolChain/Host/x86_64 directory.  This was apparently for building this against an x86_64 target, which doesn't seem to be a useful thing.
